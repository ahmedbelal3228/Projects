Project: Department Salary Raise Tool

Description:
This console-based tool allows users to give salary raises to all employees
within a specific department. The program checks if the department exists,
then applies the raise and shows the updated salary details.

Features:
- Takes user input for department and raise amount
- Validates department existence and numeric input
- Updates salaries for all employees in the chosen department
- Displays before-and-after salary info per employee

Goal:
Practice working with:
- Lists of dictionaries
- Input validation and user interaction
- Looping, conditional logic, and data manipulation
